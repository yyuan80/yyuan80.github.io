        <p>My journey of studying computer programming started in September 2017 at Seneca College. 
          Through more than two years of learning and 8 months of co-op, I had learned a lot. <br><br>       
          My passion for computer did not start in 2017 but started way back when I was at 13 years old, 
          as I really enjoyed playing video games, but some of the games required high performing PC, with limited budget, 
          buying a branded PC sometimes just could not meet the games’ requirement, 
          so I started to learn how to build a customized PC. Throughout the years, I had built several PCs for me and my friends.

          During my college study, the skills they taught me were really practical, including Object-oriented programming, Web development, System design, etc. 
          Also, the academic projects they gave me to do helped me to understand the knowledge from classes more profoundly. 
          <a href="./academic.html">Here is the link to the projects I did in school.</a>
          <br><br>
          In May 2019, I started my co-op with Bank of Montreal as Production Support Analyst, I learned a lot about how Database Administrators work in a production environment, and how was it like in a big corporation. <br><br>
          In September 2019, I switched a team in BMO, to development where I was placed in the data loading team in the Risk department. The experience was amazing, and I learned how as a software developer worked in an Agile environment.<br><br>

              In May 2019, I started my co-op term with Bank of Montreal as Production Support Analyst at Scarborough Compute Complex, it was my very first IT professional experience. 
              I was in the database team of the Production department, and our team was responsible for more than 3,000 databases. 
              My jobs are mainly about 3 parts including operational support, generate reports, and create support documents. <br><br>
      
              The major role for me is to provide operational support. I resolved many service tasks and incidents that were raised through the ticket management system, 
              ServiceNow. Let’s say if software developers want to require some data that’s in the production server, 
              they have to raise a ticket in ServiceNow, and my team then will grab the data for them, it might seem redundant, 
              but access control is very important, especially in a bank. Also, I verified backup activities for databases, drives and file systems, 
              to make sure everything work as planned.<br><br>
      
              Another task for me was to create weekly reports for the Production department to review critical issues and system health. In ServiceNow, 
              every incident was recorded, so at the end of every week, I extracted the incidents’ data for that week and created reports for the department director and managers. 
              The data extracted from ServiceNow was not easy to read, so I used pivot tables and charts to make it easier to understand and identified frequently repeat issues. <br><br>

              Followed by my first co-op term, I was able to successfully secure my second co-op term with BMO again. 
              This time, my role was Software Developer and the location had been moved to First Canadian Place, this was what I really wanted, to develop something. <br><br>  
      
              I was placed in the data loading team in the Risk department. Every day, there will be so much market risk data that needed to be loaded into databases, 
              so my team was responsible for the development and maintenance of a data loading tool. The tool was able to extract, transform and load (ETL) market risk data.<br><br> 
      
              The first two weeks were a little challenging to me, as I needed to learn how to use the ETL tools, and also, I needed to understand the existing codes in a short period of time, 
              but as time went by, I was getting better and better. This time, besides the daily data loading tasks, 
              I had two projects mainly; to enhance and maintain the ETL tools and to troubleshoot/debug the loading status page.<br><br> 
      
              The ETL tools were written in a combination of Java, Bash Script, and SQL queries. My very first contribution was an enhancement task. 
              The ETL tools were used by multiple teams in the Risk department, but the tools at that time could only be used by one user at the same time. 
              My task was to make it could be used by multiple users. To do that, I updated the Bash Scripts that launches the tools, 
              updated all the Linux profiles for each team that will be using it, 
              and finally updated Java property files to make the tools avoided the location conflicts in the shared drive.<br><br>
      
              Another task I worked on was to expand and update in the existing database schema for new requirements. 
              At first, I thought this would be an easy task, it seemed only need to update and add columns, but I was wrong. 
              The databases had multiple tiers of staging tables; 
              it would take the input data went through different filtering processes to make sure there wouldn’t be any bad data to corrupt the existing databases. 
              After I understood how this process worked, I was able to add and update the columns along with the filtering processes for each staging tables successfully.<br><br>
      
              After each task I worked on, I tested it on our dev databases, if it passed the test, I would update Jira and Bitbucket to track each task and for code review.<br><br>
      
              My second project is to troubleshoot and debug the data loading status page’s display error caused by database migration from Netezza SQL to PostgreSQL. 
              The page was essentially a website that logs all the data loading tasks information, for example, how long did the job run, was there any error during the loading, 
              which user executed the job, and etc. Since the Risk department wanted to move from Netezza to Greenplum, 
              there were a lot of the Netezza functions would not work on the Greenplum. My job was to correct all those bugs.<br><br>
      
              To debug, I had to go through the logs for the page, after I found out which function was causing the problem, 
              I need to find the description of the Netezza function and replace it with the Greenplum version. After I tested it on my machine, 
              I would update the Jira, and commit to the Bitbucket for code review. Once the senior member in my team approved my changes, 
              I would write my new findings on my team’s Confluence page for future references.<br><br>
      
              Another thing I did for this project was to set up different versions of the status page for the development team and the production team, 
              which I had to modify the JavaScript files that used Grunt, to active/disable certain functions of the page.<br><br>
      
              Before my term ends, I created detailed instructions for new hires about how to use the ETL tools to ease their onboarding and save some time for the senior members.<br><br>
